Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and applications in a network from Windows computing systems. WMI is installed on all computers with Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003. It can be downloaded for computers using Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0. WMI is the Microsoft implementation of Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which is built on the Common Information Model (CIM), a computer industry standard for defining device and application characteristics so that system administrators and management programs can control devices and applications from multiple manufacturers or sources in the same way.

- ATL Server support has been removed from this version of Visual Studio. In case your ATL Project uses any ATL Server functionality, your project may not build. Please consult the MSDN documentation for a list of alternatives. 
- Web deployment to the local IIS server is no longer supported. The Web Deployment build tool has been removed from your project settings. 
- This application has been updated to include settings related to the User Account Control (UAC) feature of Windows Vista. By default, when run on Windows Vista with UAC enabled, this application is marked to run with the same privileges as the process that launched it. This marking also disables the application from running with virtualization. You can change UAC related settings from the Property Pages of the project.
