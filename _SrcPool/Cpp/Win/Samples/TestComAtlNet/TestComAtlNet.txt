ACTIVE TEMPLATE LIBRARY : TestComAtlNet Project Overview
===============================================================================

AppWizard has created this TestComAtlNet project for you to use as the starting point for
writing your Service (EXE).
This project is implemented with Visual C++ attributes.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

TestComAtlNet.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

_TestComAtlNet.idl
    This file will be generated by the compiler when the project is built. It will contain the IDL 
    definitions of the type library, the interfaces and co-classes defined in your project.
    This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
        C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations (.\idl\_TestComAtlNet.h)
        GUID definitions                                (.\idl\_TestComAtlNet_i.c)
        A type library                                  (.\idl\_TestComAtlNet.tlb)
        Marshaling code                                 (.\idl\_TestComAtlNet_p.c and .\idl\dlldata.c)
TestComAtlNet.cpp
    This file contains the object map and the implementation of WinMain, ServiceMain, and
    the service management functions.
TestComAtlNet.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named TestComAtlNet.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Proxy/stub DLL project and module definition file:

TestComAtlNetps.vcproj
    This file is the project file for building a proxy/stub DLL if necessary.
	The IDL file in the main project must contain at least one interface and you must 
	first compile the IDL file before building the proxy/stub DLL.	This process generates
	dlldata.c, TestComAtlNet_i.c and TestComAtlNet_p.c which are required
	to build the proxy/stub DLL.

TestComAtlNetps.def
    This module definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
    required by the proxy/stub.

Visual Studio .Net 2005 8.0 Notes
----------------------------------------
  COM Bug: some of our classes are causing C4701 warnings from the "injected" attribute code
      "warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'pp' used"
      The code is "injected" from the ATL library; pp variable is not initialized if an exception happens.
      You have a few options to workaround the warning:

      1. Disable the warning globally. Specifying /wd4701 on the compiler command line

      2. Surround the class with event_source attribute with #pragma warning to disable the warning.
            #pragma warning(push, 4)
            #pragma warning(disable : 4701)
            [... event_source(com) ]
            class CSource : ...
            {
                public:
                 __event __interface ...;
            ...
            };    // CSource
            #pragma warning(pop)

        This will disable warning just in the class.

      3. Disable the warning around the code generated for attributes by adding the pragmas as below
            [... event_source(com) ]
            class CSource : ...
            {
                public:
                 __event __interface ...;
            ...
            #pragma warning(push, 4)
            #pragma warning(disable : 4701)
            };    // CSource
            #pragma warning(pop)
