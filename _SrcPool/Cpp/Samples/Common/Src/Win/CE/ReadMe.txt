       Windows CE APPLICATION : Test
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this Test application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Test application.

main.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

Test.vcp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.vcp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

Test.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows CE resources that the
    program uses.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    eMbedded Visual C++.

Test.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file Test.rc.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

stdafx.h, stdafx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Test.pch and a precompiled types file named stdafx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

Newres.h
    This header file is used to replace the ..\mfc\include\afxres.h.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

For the Debug build is necessary to define _DEBUG macro along with predefined
DEBUG macro

An "console" application requires _CONSOLE macro in order to be consistent with
Windows desktop applications
