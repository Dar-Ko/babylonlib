Metrowerks Standard Library for Palm OS® Release Notes
===============================================================================

Version: 9.0
Date:    19 September 2002
Authors: Ben Combee, Howard Hinnant, Cecilia Rodriguez

===============================================================================

This is the second supported release of the Metrowerks Standard Libraries
for Palm OS.  This release includes a partial port of the standard C and C++
libraries.

To use MSL, you need to add this access path to your project in the system
access path list:

{Compiler}\CW for Palm OS Support

The MSL source, include, and library files are located in the MSL tree under 
this folder.

This library does not attempt to implement everything, but instead provides
useful functionality for the Palm OS environment.  Because of this, code
you have written for a full standard library may require some reimplementation.

The code for this library is based on MSL 8.0, which shipped as part of
CodeWarrior Professional for Macintosh/Windows, version 8.0 in May 2002.
These files are stored in a separate tree from the MSL used in CW Pro, so they
don't require integration.

===============================================================================
Known Problems
===============================================================================

In cfloat (float.h), the values defined for LDBL_MAX and LDBL_EPSILON may not
be correct.  Long doubles are not supported by the Palm OS math library.

atof and stdtod are not marked as unimplemented in cstdlib but actually are
not implemented for Palm OS

===============================================================================
Standard C Library
===============================================================================

A full set of standard headers for a freestanding implemention of Standard C
are provided.  This set is defined by section 4 of the ISO C (1999) document
to include <float.h>, <iso646.h>, <limits.h>, <stdarg.h>, <stdbool.h>, 
<stddef.h>, and <stdint.h>.

In addition to these headers, some additional standard library functionality
is provided as follows:

<assert.h>
    assert

<errno.h>
    errno

<stdlib.h>
    atoi, atol, strtol, strtoul, rand, srand, calloc, free, malloc, 
    realloc, __msize, RAND_MAX, abort, exit, bsearch, qsort, div_t,
    ldiv_t, abs, labs,  div, ldiv

<string.h>
    everything but strerror and __strerror

<time.h>
    CLOCKS_PER_SEC, clock_t, clock

<stdio.h>
    EOF

No implementations are provided for items mentioned in these headers:

    <signal.h>, <wctype.h>, <wchar.h>, <locale.h>, <math.h>
	
If you need standard math functions, we provide the 3rd party library
MathLib in the Other SDKs folder.  This shared library has implementations
of most common math functions and is widely used on the Palm OS platform.	

This version of MSL implements many of these functions as part of a static
library.  Ones that directly correspond to Palm OS API functions are implemented
as inline functions.

===============================================================================
Standard C++ Library
===============================================================================

The standard C++ library is provided both as a set of headers and as a static
library.

The "STL" part of the standard C++ library is present, but there is no
support for locales, numerics, and file/console I/O.  Below are the standard
headers that have been ported to Palm OS:

algorithm
bitset
deque
exception
functional
iosfwd
iterator
limits
list
map
memory
new
numeric
queue
set
stack
stdexcept
string
typeinfo
utility
vector

These headers are provided, but functionality related to file I/O or console I/O
has been disabled:

iomanip
ios
istream
ostream
sstream
streambuf
strstream

The following standard headers are not available on Palm OS:

fstream
iostream
locale
complex
valarray

In addition to the standard headers, these non-standard headers are also
