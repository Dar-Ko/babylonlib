\	StlTools.dsp	Microsoft Developer Studio Project (DSP) file is a generated build file, format version 6.00 (MSVC6).	Win32
\	StlTools.vcproj	Microsoft Developer Studio 2005 Project (vcproj) file is a generated build file, format version 8.0 (MSVC8 2005).	Win32
\	StlTools7.vcproj	Microsoft Developer Studio .Net 2003 Project (vcproj) file is a generated build file, format version 7.10 (MSVC7.3).	Win32

If compiled with MSVC 7.+ .Net in same directory where are object compiled with previous version of Visual Studio (MSVC 6.0 for example), following error will occur:
  LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'libcid.lib'
Solution is to clean all intermidiate files (.obj) and to recomile the project again.

Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2005 v8.0
Conversion Issues:
- Visual C++ now supports a secure version of the C Runtime Library. Use of this library is turned on by default. You may see some warnings about deprecated functions when you build your project. It is advised that you correct these warnings, in order to make your code more secure. 
- compliance with ISO Standard C++: 
    - enforcing Standard C++ for loop scoping; 
    - supporting wchar_t as a native type. 
- The single-threaded run-time library switches (/MLd, /ML) have been removed from the C++ compiler. The project has been automatically converted to use the corresponding multi-threaded run-time library switches (/MTd, /MT). 
- Due to the requirement that Visual C++ projects produce an embedded (by default) Windows SxS manifest, manifest files in the project are automatically excluded from building with the Manifest Tool. It is recommended that the dependency information contained in any manifest files be converted to "#pragma comment(linker,"<insert dependency here>")" in a header file that is included from your source code. If your project already embeds a manifest in the RT_MANIFEST resource section through a resource (.rc) file, the line will need to be commented out before the project will build correctly. 
- Due to a conformance change in the C++ compiler, code change may be required before your project will build without errors. Previous versions of the C++ compiler allowed specification of member function pointers by member function name (e.g. MemberFunctionName). The C++ standard requires a fully qualified name with the use of the address-of operator (e.g. &ClassName::MemberFunctionName). If your project contains forms or controls used in the Windows Forms Designer, you may have to change code in InitializeComponent because the designer generated code used the non-conformant syntax in delegate construction (used in event handlers).
