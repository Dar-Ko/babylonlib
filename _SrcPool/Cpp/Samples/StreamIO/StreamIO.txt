A LNK2005 error occurs when the CRT library and MFC libraries are linked in the wrong order in Visual C++

When the C Run-Time (CRT) library and Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) libraries are linked in the wrong order, you may receive one of the following LNK2005 errors:
    nafxcwd.lib(afxmem.obj) : error LNK2005:
    "void * __cdecl operator new(unsigned int)"(??2@YAPAXI@Z) already defined in LIBCMTD.lib(new.obj) 
When you use the MFC libraries, you must make sure that they are linked before the CRT library is linked. You can do this by making sure that every file in your project includes Msdev\Mfc\Include\Afx.h first, either directly (#include <Afx.h>) or indirectly (#include <Stdafx.h>). The Afx.h include file forces the correct order of the libraries, by using the #pragma comment (lib,"<libname>") directive.
If the source file has a .c extension, or the file has a .cpp extension but does not use MFC, you can create and include a small header file (KAfxLib.h) at the top of the module.
This new header makes sure that the library search order is correct.

Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2005 v8.0
Conversion Issues:
- Visual C++ now supports a secure version of the C Runtime Library. Use of this library is turned on by default. You may see some warnings about deprecated functions when you build your project. It is advised that you correct these warnings, in order to make your code more secure. 
- compliance with ISO Standard C++: 
    - enforcing Standard C++ for loop scoping; 
    - supporting wchar_t as a native type. 
- The single-threaded run-time library switches (/MLd, /ML) have been removed from the C++ compiler. The project has been automatically converted to use the corresponding multi-threaded run-time library switches (/MTd, /MT). 
- Due to the requirement that Visual C++ projects produce an embedded (by default) Windows SxS manifest, manifest files in the project are automatically excluded from building with the Manifest Tool. It is recommended that the dependency information contained in any manifest files be converted to "#pragma comment(linker,"<insert dependency here>")" in a header file that is included from your source code. If your project already embeds a manifest in the RT_MANIFEST resource section through a resource (.rc) file, the line will need to be commented out before the project will build correctly. 
- Due to a conformance change in the C++ compiler, code change may be required before your project will build without errors. Previous versions of the C++ compiler allowed specification of member function pointers by member function name (e.g. MemberFunctionName). The C++ standard requires a fully qualified name with the use of the address-of operator (e.g. &ClassName::MemberFunctionName). If your project contains forms or controls used in the Windows Forms Designer, you may have to change code in InitializeComponent because the designer generated code used the non-conformant syntax in delegate construction (used in event handlers).
