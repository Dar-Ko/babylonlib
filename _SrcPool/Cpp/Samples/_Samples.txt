Notes
-----

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 debugger does not support the symbol format (.pdb) introduced with system symbols of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. See http://www.debuginfo.com/tools/symgetex.html for MSVC 6 plug-in for downloading symbols from a server.

Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2005 v8.0
Conversion Issues:
- Visual C++ now supports a secure version of the C Runtime Library. Use of this library is turned on by default. You may see some warnings about deprecated functions when you build your project. It is advised that you correct these warnings, in order to make your code more secure.
- compliance with ISO Standard C++:
    - enforcing Standard C++ for loop scoping;
    - supporting wchar_t as a native type.
- The single-threaded run-time library switches (/MLd, /ML) have been removed from the C++ compiler. The project has been automatically converted to use the corresponding multi-threaded run-time library switches (/MTd, /MT).
- Due to the requirement that Visual C++ projects produce an embedded (by default) Windows SxS manifest, manifest files in the project are automatically excluded from building with the Manifest Tool. It is recommended that the dependency information contained in any manifest files be converted to "#pragma comment(linker,"<insert dependency here>")" in a header file that is included from your source code. If your project already embeds a manifest in the RT_MANIFEST resource section through a resource (.rc) file, the line will need to be commented out before the project will build correctly.
- Due to a conformance change in the C++ compiler, code change may be required before your project will build without errors. Previous versions of the C++ compiler allowed specification of member function pointers by member function name (e.g. MemberFunctionName). The C++ standard requires a fully qualified name with the use of the address-of operator (e.g. &ClassName::MemberFunctionName). If your project contains forms or controls used in the Windows Forms Designer, you may have to change code in InitializeComponent because the designer generated code used the non-conformant syntax in delegate construction (used in event handlers).

Microsoft Visual Studio format versions

	Visual Studio	 .vcproj   	   .sln
	     ver.    	format ver.	format ver.
	-------------------------------------------
	2003  7.1    	   7.1     	    8.0    	xxx8.sln <- xxx7.vcproj
	2005  8.0    	   8.0     	    9.0    	xxx9.sln <- xxx8.vcproj
	2008  9.0    	   9.0     	   10.0    	 xxx.sln <-  xxx.vcproj working version

Borland C++ Compiler

Exception while using Microsoft DLLs with bcc32.exe
Apparently Microsoft and Borland didn't agree how to handle floating point exceptions.
Following workaraound ignores those in applications compiled with Borland compiler:

   #include <floats.h>
  _clear87();
  _control87( MCW_EM, MCW_EM );

Virtual Machine:
----------------
In a Linux virtual machine, shared folders appear under /mnt/hgfs. So the shared folder would appear as /mnt/hgfs/<shared folder>. 

CVS Linux:
----------
- install <selected package>
  <selected package> is 'cvs' or 'cvsnt;
		sudo apt-get install <selected package>
- set /home/<user>/.cvspass
  set the CVSROOT environment variable
		export CVSROOT=:pserver:<cvsuser>@<cvsserverurl>:/CVS
		cvs login
  if .cvspass does not exist, it will be created
