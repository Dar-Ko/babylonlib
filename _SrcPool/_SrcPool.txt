Note: Depending on the platform, wchar_t and L"String literals" may or may not be Unicode, and if they are Unicode, they could be UTF-16 or UCS-4.
Non-Unicode forms can crop up on some platforms in some Asian locales, and sometimes on EBCDIC based mainframes.
Portable Unicode based applications need to stay away from any use of wchar_t and the whatever family of functions that support wchar_t.
Setting up Unicode string constants in portable C or C++ has no language support at all, and is a complete pain.
The usual approach is to define a series of individual numeric constants for each character needed, then use a C array initializer to put together the string.

Note: Visual Basic 6 reports an error in temporary files if forms contain an icon with images ordered as in Doc/Res/SrcPool.ico. Forms with the icon Cpp/Win/Res/Win/SrcPool.ico are compiled without errors.
